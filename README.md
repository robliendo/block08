Learning Teams: Connecting



Where are we going?
Learning Objectives 
4
After today’s lesson, you should:
Describe the common roles and responsibilities within a development team. 
Orients students by presenting an agenda, sharing learning goals, and summarizing at transitions 



What is In It for Me? (WIIFM?)
5
In your future working environments you will be placed in projects development teams. 

Depending on the company culture and size they can use a mixture of these methodologies. It is important to adapt in the different style of teams.


6
Programming Methodologies 
Programs to solve real-life problems are often complex and large. 

Programming Methods = process of analyzing, planning, and controlling software development 
explain what programming methodologies are

7
Programming Methodologies 
PAIR PROGRAMMING 
MOB PROGRAMMING 

Pair Programming
8
A pair of programmers work at the same workstation at the same time.
*note the “workstation” can be remote!

Driver/Navigator roles 

Think of it as driving a car, you have a driver and a navigator
Driver/navigator role in pairing is at its best more akin to micro/macro. 
Driver is working on implementation, navigator considers direction, strategy, and higher level architecture/impact.

Pair Programming - Benefits/Drawbacks
9
Benefits
Thought partner
Quicker
Learning opportunities

Drawbacks
Inefficiencies (two doing the job of one)
Increased development costs
Personality types
Benefits
Bounce ideas and answer questions
Delivery of projects can be quicker
Pairs can learn new coding and workflow techniques

Drawbacks
Two people on one problem can be seen as inefficient
Can lead to higher development costs
Introverted personality types may be overstimulated by working with somebody all day, everyday constantly communicating


Demonstration: Pair Programming
Please have two instructors or an instructor and mentor demonstrate how pair programming works.

Work the following Javascript problem:
Compute the sum of the two given integers.

const num1 = 5;
const num2 = 3;

// add two numbers
const sum = num1 + num2;

// display the sum
console.log('The sum of ' + num1 + ' and ' + num2 + ' is: ' + sum);


Mob Programming
11
Whole team, one project, one computer
Four to six people

The whole team works together on one project in real time and on one computer
Similar to pair programming but has about 4-6 people
The team will rotate and there is a navigator, driver, the facilitator which keeps the team on task, and the mob is who selects the best course of action.


Mob Programming Benefits/Drawbacks
12
Benefits 
Real-time reviews
Continuous learning
Fast feedback

Drawbacks
Team dynamics learning styles and differences
Inefficient
Avoid participation and/or one person monopolizes time

Benefits 
Real-time reviews
Continuous learning
Fast feedback

Drawbacks
Team dynamics learning styles and differences
It can be inefficient to have multiple people solving one problem
Easy for inexperienced or less confident team members to avoid participation, or for more senior members to monopolize time

Project Planning
13
Benefits 
Improves team communication
Easy to track goals/outcomes
Saves companies money by reducing delays and scope creep



14
Project Management Methodologies 
Methodologies
Waterfall
Agile
Scrum
Kanban
Many others!
Important to note here to the students: These methodology terms and roles are not a set in stone science. Depending on the source or company, steps in the process or role titles and responsibilities may shift slights. These descriptions are only examples of how the process may operate. 

Waterfall
15
Each phase passes down onto the next. Each phase depends on the previous one to be complete.

All the project requirements are gathered at the beginning.

Explain all the phases in details.
Requirements:- In this phase, all possible requirements for the system are captured and documented in a requirements specification.
Design:- In this phase, the system design is prepared based on the requirements specifications from the first phase.
Implementation:- System designs are incorporated into small programs called units, which are then integrated into the next phase. A unit is developed and tested for its functionality, which is known as unit testing.
Verification:- Units developed in the implementation phase are integrated into a system after they have been tested. Any faults and failures are detected after integration.
Maintenance:- In the client environment, some issues arise, and patches are released to fix those issues. The product is also enhanced with better versions. Maintenance is done to deliver these changes in the customer environment.

Waterfall Benefits/Drawbacks
16
Benefits 
Clear structure 
Clear requirements 
Easy to measure progress

Drawbacks
It is difficult to know all possible requirements at the beginning. 
It means a slow start. 
It is rigid, and you cannot make changes during development.

Benefits 
Has a clear structure and transfers information well
Requirements are clear and accurately stated
Easy to measure progress

Drawbacks
It’s difficult to know all possible requirements at the beginning of a project
Can be a slow beginning because of all the requirements needed at the beginning
Extremely difficult to make changes during development


Common Agile-Scrum Implementation
17
This method uses teams of five to nine members.

Scrum takes a large project and breaks it into bite-sized tasks for the individual team members to complete.

Teams can be of 5-9 people
Some projects require members to take on multiple roles
Scrum takes a large project and breaks it into bite-sized tasks for individual team members to complete

Explain the phases in detail.

Concept:- The goal and scope of the software will be determined by the stakeholder. The product owner will create a document outlining the product's key requirements.
Inception or Requirement Identification:- A product owner determines the availability of co-developers and selects the best candidates.
Iteration or Development:- In the phase of concept and inception, the development team will collect all the requirements for the product.
Release:- Quality assurance ensures the software's functionality before releasing it.
Maintenance:- To ensure that the software runs smoothly without any bugs, the development team provides regular support to the customer.
Retirement:- It can be triggered either by new software being introduced or by a system becoming outdated or incompatible with the organization.



Common Agile-Scrum Implementation
18
Tasks = added to backlog

Run in “sprints”
One to four weeks
Team members pick up tasks 

Tasks are created from the larger project, at the beginning of each sprint, team members pick up or are assigned tasks from backlog and work to complete in that sprint 

Common Agile-Scrum Implementation
19
Explain the process using the diagram, remember to share this is ONE way to implement, every company and resource will vary a bit on how this is described or implemented

Agile Scrum - Benefits/Drawbacks
20
Benefits
Simultaneously rather than sequentially
Adaptation/Changes

Drawbacks
Scope creep
Lots of meetings 
Benefits
Allows coding on the fly b/c work is done simultaneously vs sequentially
Projects can adapt and client change requests can happen

Drawbacks
Can cause scope creep which leads to the team not meeting deadlines or certain requirements
Requires constant sprint meetings and standups which can be exhausting

Roles and Responsibilities
21
Role
Responsibility
Product Owner
The owner has a deep knowledge of the project, and is the voice of the customer. 
They can make decisions on the product and provide product guidance to the team.
Architect
The architect designs the plans and specifications for a project.
Team Lead
The Team Lead is responsible for the group, keeping the goal in mind, the day-to-day supervision and assigning tasks.
Scrum Master
The Scrum Master is the keeper of the process. They coach the team and keep the team focused. The Scrum Master also mediates and negotiates with outside pressures.
Senior Developer
The Senior Developer guides the group by reviewing code for accuracy and functionality.
Mid/Jr Developer
The Mid-level or Junior Developer reviews code, does the troubleshooting, and attends development meetings.
Quality Assurance Engineer
The Quality Assurance Engineer builds out tests that will identify issues and creates reports for stakeholders.
**Multiple roles may be inhabited by a single person depending on project/team.

Kanban
22
Kanban uses a board to map out workflow.
It is used in agile project management frameworks.
Kanban takes a large project and breaks it into workflow stages similar to sprints, but it is not time based.
Kanban views the process as a continuous flow.

Kanban uses a physical/virtual board to map out workflow.
It falls under the Agile project management frameworks.
Kanban focuses on taking a large project and breaking it into workflow stages similar to sprints, but it is not time based.
Kanban views the process as a continuous flow.

Kanban - Benefits/Drawbacks
23
Benefits
Board visibility
Encourages collaboration 

Drawbacks
Does not show timelines for each phase 
No clear product roadmap

Benefits
Visible board quickly shows which stage of the project you are on
Encourages collaboration on how tasks fit into the overall project
Everyone has access to the board and communicate with one another to get the project done

Drawbacks
Doesn’t show timelines for each phase of the project
Very hard for clients or stakeholders to see a product roadmap

Kanban vs Scrum
24
Kanban
Scrum
Kanban has no defined roles
Scrum master, product owner, and development team
Kanban cycles are continuous

Sprint cycle lasts one to four weeks
Kanban can handle new changes anytime
Generall not made during sprint, but can be made between sprints


GitHub Projects: Kanban Board Demonstration

Introduction to Personal Website Part I
Demo creating GitHub Organizations and Project Boards - use another ITM  or student to share/collaborate with. 
Open and introduce the Personal Website Pt I Career Simulation. After introducing the project, use it to make several items in the Project board and demonstrate for students how to use the board. 



Choosing the Right Methodology
26
Complexity of the project
Team members
Budget (rigid or variable)
Culture and dynamics 

Complexity of the project
Example: waterfall would work great for an assembly line type of business
Scrum is good for businesses with constant updates and fast turnaround times
Size of the team and their skills
Projected budget for the project
Culture and dynamics of projects
